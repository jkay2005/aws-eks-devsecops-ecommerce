# [Ecommerce Application](https://ecommerce-application-jyip.onrender.com/)

A monorepo for a full-stack Ecommerce application featuring a client side built with React and a server side with Express.js. PostgreSQL is used as the database for data persistence. This repository provides the entire stack in a single architecture to streamline development and deployment processes.

## Project Structure

This project follows a monorepo architecture with the following structure:

```bash
Ecommerce_application
    ├── client
    │ └── public
    │ └── src
    ├── server
    │ ├── controllers
    │ ├── models
    │ │ └── tables.sql
    │ └── routes
    │ └── index.js
    └── package.json
```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Shared repository structure for client and server code

## Features

- **Filter Products by Category**: Users can browse products and filter them by category for a better shopping experience.
- **User Authentication**: Includes options for user login and registration.
- **GitHub Sign-Up**: Users can sign up quickly using their GitHub account.
- **Order Placement**: Both authenticated and non-authenticated users can place orders, with additional benefits for logged-in users.
- **Cart Checkout and Payment Processing**: Integrated Stripe payment gateway allows secure checkout and payment processing.

## Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and install dependencies for both the client and server:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Medo-ID/Ecommerce_application.git
   cd Ecommerce_application
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - For monorepo we use workspaces, you can run in the root directory

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   **This will install dependencies for all packages defined in the workspace configuration.**

   - If you want to install new scopes and private packages in Workspaces you can run:

   ```bash
   npm install @scope/package-example --workspace "name of workspace client || server"
   ```

## Setup and Configuration

1. **Database Setup**:

   - Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed.
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database for the application.
   - Run the `tables.sql` script located in `server/models` to set up the necessary tables:

   ```sql
   \i path/to/tables.sql
   ```

   - Update your database credentials and configuration in the server code as required.

2. **Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder with the following variables:

   ```env
   # server port
   PORT=<this one for development you can use 3000>

   # database url
   DB_URL=<your postgresql url for database connection>

   # express session
   SESSION_SECRET=<strong secret for session>

   # front end url
   FRONT_DOMAIN=<font end url || http://localhost:3001>

   # envirement
   SERVER_URL=<url for dev backend || http://localhost:3000>
   NODE_ENV=<development>

   # github auth 2.0 api keys
   GITHUB_CLIENT=<github client>
   GITHUB_SECRET=<github secret>

   # stripe payment api keys
   STRIPE_PUBLIC=<stripe public key>
   STRIPE_SECRET=<stripe secret key>
   ```

3. **Frontend Configuration**:
   - Ensure any necessary API URLs are configured in the client side code under `client/src`.
   - Create a `.env` file in the `client` folder with the following variables
   ```env
   PORT=3001
   REACT_APP_API_URL=<our back end url api || http://localhost:3000>
   REACT_APP_ENV=<development>
   ```

## Running the Application

- **Start the App**:
  - **To start both the client and server concurrently, use the following command in the root directory:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This command will run both the client and server:
    - Server: Runs on `http://localhost:3000` (as specified in `server/.env`)
    - Client: Runs on `http://localhost:3001` (as specified in `client/.env`)

## Project Structure Details

- **client/src**: Contains all React frontend code.
- **server/controllers**: Holds controller functions that manage the application logic.
- **server/models/tables.sql**: SQL script to create necessary tables for PostgreSQL.
- **server/index.js**: Entry point for the Express.js server, setting up routes and middleware.

Happy coding!

## Run the local container stack

Requirements: Git and Docker Desktop using Linux containers.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Replace `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `SESSION_SECRET` with separate random hex values.
3. Run:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build --wait --wait-timeout 120
```

Verify:

```powershell
curl.exe -i http://localhost:3000/health/ready
curl.exe -i http://localhost:3000/api/products
```

View logs:

```powershell
docker compose logs --tail 100 backend
```

Stop the stack while retaining database data:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

See `docs/phase-1.md` for verification results.
